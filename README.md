# 🌿 Smart Irrigation System (IoT - ESP8266 + Blynk)

An **IoT-based irrigation system** that automatically waters plants using a **soil moisture sensor**, **ESP8266**, and **Blynk app**.  
It helps save plants from drying up due to lack of water as well as saves water by not overwatering, and allows remote control through your phone.

## 🧠 Overview
- Measures soil moisture in real time.  
- Turns the pump **ON** when soil is dry and **OFF** when wet.  
- Can be manually controlled from the **Blynk app**.
